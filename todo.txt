[x] display all items in the pomodoro object for testing purposes
	[x] loop over all items in the object continuously with 2-3 second delay (1 second is definately too short)
	[x] hitting a button in browser halts loop

[x] use setInterval function to display a count down timer for the appropriate time
	[x] if in "focus" state, count down from 25 minutes
	[x] if in "rest" state, count down from 5 minutes
	[] after rest state, state becomes "waiting" (I believe) and a button must be pushed to start next timer

[] fix switch statement bug
[] attach event listener functionality to start and stop buttons
	[] start button starts the timer
	[] stop button stops the timer

[] develop a more attractive UX/UI with figma

[] consider rewriting using typescript and Sass
