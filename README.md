# pomodoroMvp1

First version made quickly with typical stack.


Problem:
How do we calculate 4 sets of 30 minute timers divided into 25 minute working periods and 5 minute breaks each?


Sub Problems:

1. How do we get and display time to the user?
2. What is needed to set up our first pomodoro?
3. How do we update the user of time (every second) to allow them to see their progress?
4. How do we stop the clock once we have completed a pomodoro?
5. How do we allow the user to start a break?
6. How do we extend the functionality to up to 4 pomodoros?
7. How do we congratulate the user for complete a full pomodoro?
