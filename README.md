# pomodoroMvp1

Using Google's style guide (source below) I rewrote this readme file to meet industry standards.

# What:
This is a pomodoro count down timer created with html, css, and javascript. This project's purpose is to practice solving a simple problem using all vanilla web languages. From here, I plan to recreate the project with more features. Finally, if it still makes sense, I will make desktop and phone apps. 

# Who:
Up until this moment I didn't realize that there isn't really a convenient way to contact me. So, I will set something up and add it here {} later.

# Status:
This project was created to help me master using the browser in problem solving. I will refine this project for a while but expect to jump to other more complex ones. Thus, don't expect this to be actively maintained for more than another month.
